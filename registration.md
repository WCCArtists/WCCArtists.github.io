# Registration

The workshop will follow the registration policy of ICCV 2025 main conference. 

Each paper MUST be registered under an AUTHOR registration.  (There is a student rate under AUTHOR) One registration may cover up to three papers inclusive of main conference or workshop papers. Additional papers will have to be registered under a separate registration.

Virtual registrations will not cover a paper submission - even workshop papers. If circumstances prevent you from attending in person to present your paper, you may attend virtually but you must register and pay for your paper under an in-person registration and please select that you will attend virtually.
