## Diversity & Inclusion

WCCA unites perspectives across academia, industry, and cultural sectors—early‑career researchers, senior experts, and professionals from multiple continents—to foster an inclusive, multidisciplinary dialogue on AI‑driven cultural preservation.

## Social, Ethical, and Industrial Considerations

- **Social** — Democratizing public access to cultural heritage and reinforcing cultural identity  
- **Ethical** — Respecting privacy, intellectual‑property rights, and mitigating bias in digitization processes  
- **Industrial** — Forging commercial collaborations and embedding cultural narratives into digital products

## Broader Impact
By uniting researchers, industry professionals, and cultural institutions, WCCA
aims to foster collaboration in digital cultural preservation. We will address the
social and ethical considerations of digitizing art while showcasing how AI can
help sustain cultural heritage for future generations.
