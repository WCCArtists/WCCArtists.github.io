# Welcome to **WCCA 2025**

The Workshop on Cultural Continuity of Artists (WCCA) brings together researchers, creators, and cultural institutions to explore how computer vision, multimodal AI, and XR technologies can safeguard and reinterpret artistic legacies. Our inaugural edition, co‑located with ICCV 2025, highlights the visionary South Korean fashion designer **André Kim** and introduces a rich, newly curated dataset from his archives.

## Diversity & Inclusion

WCCA unites perspectives across academia, industry, and cultural sectors—early‑career researchers, senior experts, and professionals from multiple continents—to foster an inclusive, multidisciplinary dialogue on AI‑driven cultural preservation.

## Social, Ethical, and Industrial Considerations

- **Social** — Democratizing public access to cultural heritage and reinforcing cultural identity  
- **Ethical** — Respecting privacy, intellectual‑property rights, and mitigating bias in digitization processes  
- **Industrial** — Forging commercial collaborations and embedding cultural narratives into digital products

## Broader Impact
By uniting researchers, industry professionals, and cultural institutions, WCCA
aims to foster collaboration in digital cultural preservation. We will address the
social and ethical considerations of digitizing art while showcasing how AI can
help sustain cultural heritage for future generations.
