# Workshop on Cultural Continuity of Artists (WCCA)

Welcome to the **Workshop on Cultural Continuity of Artists (WCCA)** at ICCV 2025.

## Topics
- AI and computer vision for cultural heritage
- Multimodal learning with 3D scans, documents, and video
- Image and 3D generation for cultural artifacts
- Ethical and social aspects of digitizing artistic legacies

- 
## Dataset

We provide a research dataset derived from André Kim’s body of work:

- **3D scans** of his avant‑garde fashion designs  
- **Design documents** such as original sketches and production archives  
- **Show footage** capturing the atmosphere of landmark runway shows  
- **Supplementary materials** that enrich historical and cultural context

and paper presentations. Paper submissions follow the ICCV 2025 format, with a
30% acceptance rate for oral presentations.

 
## Diversity & Inclusion

WCCA unites perspectives across academia, industry, and cultural sectors—early‑career researchers, senior experts, and professionals from multiple continents—to foster an inclusive, multidisciplinary dialogue on AI‑driven cultural preservation.

## Social, Ethical, and Industrial Considerations

- **Social** — Democratizing public access to cultural heritage and reinforcing cultural identity  
- **Ethical** — Respecting privacy, intellectual‑property rights, and mitigating bias in digitization processes  
- **Industrial** — Forging commercial collaborations and embedding cultural narratives into digital products

## Broader Impact
By uniting researchers, industry professionals, and cultural institutions, WCCA
aims to foster collaboration in digital cultural preservation. We will address the
social and ethical considerations of digitizing art while showcasing how AI can
help sustain cultural heritage for future generations.
