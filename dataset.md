# Dataset

We provide a research dataset derived from André Kim’s body of work:

- **3D scans** of his avant‑garde fashion designs  
- **Design documents** such as original sketches and production archives  
- **Show footage** capturing the atmosphere of landmark runway shows  
- **Supplementary materials** that enrich historical and cultural context
